> Share & grow the world's knowledge!
> 
A website that allows users to ask and answer questions on various topics.

## Main features
### ❓ Forum features
You can: ask, answer and report questions, interact with other users and stuff. Pretty much you'd do in a normal forum, but with a lot of cool and additional features :)

### 🆙 XP and level
Users gain or lose reputation based on the quality of their interactions with the system and other community members. Reputation is a rough measurement in experience (XP) of how much the community trusts you; it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what you’re talking about. Every user starts in level 1 (0 XP), and you can reach the next level by gaining enough XP.

When you're logged in, is also possible to see all your reputation stats (overall stats and earned XP per day in the last 7 days)!

### 🏷️ Tags
You can see all tags in the website, as well as see the questions each one has. It is also possible to follow one or multiple tags, then your feed will only display questions related to the tags you follow.

### 💬 Notifications
When your question has a new answer, or one of your answers was chosen by a user, you get a notification.

### 👤 User profile
Every user has a profile in the website that shows their activity, stats, level and all of that jazz.

### 🏆 Top users
In the index page (and also in every tag page), there is a top users card! It shows the users with most XP in the whole site or in every specific tag.

### ⚙️ Moderation
- Questz has a complete moderation panel to watch user activity, including Questions, Answers, Reports, Tags and Users. 
- In the Questions/Answers panel there is also a tool to watch for restricted words and make the moderation job easier. 
- There is a "strike" system too. If a user has 3 strikes, he is automatically banned from the website. Users receive warning and can, at any time, see how many strikes they have.

### 🔢 Sort questions by Popularity, Last Update, Answered or Unanswered
The questions in the site are, by default, sorted by popularity, but you can also sort them by Last Update, Answered or Unanswered.

### 📱 Social media features
In Questz, it is possible to:
- Share a question or answer in WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or Email.
- Like a question or a answer.
- Follow a tag.
- See user activity in their profile page.
