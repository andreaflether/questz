  <p class="fst-italic">
    <b>In Short:</b>
    We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and 
    technical security measures.
  </p>

  <p>
    We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to
    protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards
    and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or 
    information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise
    or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be
    able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
    Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal
    information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website
    within a secure environment.
