    <p>
      Users gain or lose reputation based on the quality of their interactions with the system and 
      other community members. Reputation is a rough measurement in <b>experience (XP)</b> of how 
      much the community trusts you; it is earned by convincing your peers that you know what youâ€™re 
      talking about. Every user starts in level 1 (0 XP), and you can reach the next level by 
      gaining enough XP.

            all of its answers are automatically deleted as well. This event is also used when a 
            user is removed.
